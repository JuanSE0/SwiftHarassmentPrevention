# Harassment in the workplace prevention: iOS, ipadOS and macOS app

### About:

This repo shows a brief demo of the app developed for iOS, ipadOS and macOS in Swift using SwiftUI as part of my
Bachelor thesis.

### Explanation:

The idea was to provide an easy and familiar way of communication between HR and employees ensuring employee anonymity.
The app focused on anonymous reports and getting up-to-date information regarding policies and articles about harassment
in the workplace. The objective was to reduce the toxic situations that may occur in the workplace and increasing the
contact between employees and HR promoting healthier workplace environments leading to less harassment.
